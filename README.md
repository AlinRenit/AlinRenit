## 💡 About Me

I'm a B.Tech CSE student at VIT Vellore, passionate about turning ideas into code. My core interests lie in **full-stack web development**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **cybersecurity**.

Currently exploring:
- ⚙️ Scalable backend design with **Spring Boot**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**
- 🌐 Responsive frontend UIs with **React**, **Material UI**, and **TypeScript**
- ☁️ Deployments using **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **AWS EC2 / S3**
